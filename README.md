# Covid19-Happiness-Prediction
This repository is for an extra credit project on covid-19 to be presented for CMPSC 465 ( Data Structures and algorithms) 

## Main Research Statement
Everyone is stuck in their homes and are encouraged to stay inside during this worldwide pandemic, but the question we come across now is this going to benefit our mental health while staying indoors?

## Solution(Projected Idea) 

### First Stage of Preliminary Analysis: 
This analysis will mainly focus on projecting when the quarantine period would end. Essentially building a prediction model using sckikit learn and a greedy algorithm to give out a possible prediction on when the exponential curve of spread(coronavirus) slopes down. 

### Second Stage of Preliminary Analysis: 

This would mainly include collection of data from various data sources that can be the happiness index released by WHO and other major sources like WHO, and possible surveys sent to a particular sample set of people. This would give us a certain idea on how to create variables through which we can possibly predict mental health wellness amongst people and how it will be if quarantine exists for when it is predicted till.
